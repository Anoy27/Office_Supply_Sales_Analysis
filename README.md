# Office_Wizard_Sales_Analysis
I partnered with US-based office supply company Office Wizard to create an insightful Power BI dashboard for their new investor. The goal was to analyze 4 years of sales data and uncover the reasons behind low profits in 2017, despite high sales. This interactive dashboard provided actionable insights into key performance metrics and addressed critical business questions:
1. Yearly sales and profit trends.
2. Top-performing cities, states, and regions for sales and profit, and identification of low-performing areas.
3. Segments, categories, sub-categories, and products driving sales and profit.
4. The impact of discounts on loss-making products and identification of loss drivers.

## Data Preparation:
The dataset was thoroughly cleaned, removing duplicates, outliers, incorrect values, and redundant rows. Rows containing partial 2018 data were excluded to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The dashboard features a clean, user-friendly design aligned with the company's branding. Each page uses a minimalist layout with a maximum of four visuals per page, supplemented by interactive buttons and slicers for seamless navigation and deeper analysis.
### Page 1: Overview

Focuses on yearly sales and profit trends, top regions, and growth metrics.
Features a line chart, bar charts, slicer for year selection, and KPI cards for YoY growth and totals.

### Page 2: Products

Highlights sales and profit trends by product category, sub-category, and segment.
Includes pie charts, bar charts, and interactive buttons for detailed sales and profit views.

### Page 3: Profit and Loss Analysis

Examines the relationship between discounts and loss-making products, identifying categories and products with high losses.
Utilizes scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts for a comprehensive analysis.

## Key Features:
1. Dynamic Buttons: Interactive buttons switch between sales and profit views, providing tailored insights.
2. Slicers: Enable filtering by year for granular analysis.
3. Performance Metrics: Cards displaying total sales, profits, and YoY growth metrics at a glance.
4. Theme Alignment: Customized design matching the companyâ€™s logo and brand identity.

This project empowered the client to make informed decisions by presenting a clear, actionable story behind their sales and profit performance. The dashboard's intuitive interactivity and detailed insights impressed the stakeholders, including the investor.

## Insights & Recommendations:
The analysis uncovered critical factors impacting profitability:

### Excessive Discounts to Repeated Customers:
A significant number of repeated customers were receiving disproportionately high discounts. While these customers boosted low sales purchasing low price products, they led to significant profit erosion.

### Loss-Making Products:
Several products across specific categories and sub-categories consistently incurred losses, exacerbated by heavy discounting strategies.

### Seasonality Impact:
The business exhibits clear seasonality, with higher sales and profits concentrated in Q3 and Q4. The lower sales in Q1 and Q2 significantly impact overall profitability.

## Recommendations for Business Improvement:
Based on my analysis here are a few suggestions  
### Refine Discount Strategies: 
Introduce a balanced discounting policy to reward loyalty without compromising profit margins.
Focus on Product Profitability: Reassess pricing and sales strategies for loss-making products and consider discontinuing underperforming items.
### Address Seasonality:
Launch promotional campaigns or product bundles in Q1 and Q2 to drive demand during slower periods. Optimize inventory and resource allocation to prepare for peak sales in Q3 and Q4.
### Target High-Margin Segments:
Concentrate on high-margin products and regions to maximize returns.
### Operational Efficiency: 
Optimize inventory and supply chain strategies to reduce costs associated with underperforming regions and products.

By addressing these challenges and leveraging insights, the client gained a clearer understanding of their business performance and actionable strategies to improve profitability resulting in 2.5x more profit in the next quarter.
